# Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses ðŸŽ“
This project is a simple demonstration of inheritance in JavaScript. It shows how to create a base class and extend it into specialized subclasses, a core concept in object-oriented programming.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The objective is to understand and apply the concept of inheritance and method overriding using modern JavaScript (ES6) classes.

# ðŸŒŸ Features
Base Class: The Person class serves as the foundation, holding common properties like name and age.

Subclasses: The Student and Teacher classes inherit from Person, allowing them to reuse its properties and methods.

Method Overriding: Both subclasses override the displayInfo() method to add specific details (grade for students, subject for teachers), demonstrating how child classes can customize parent methods.
